# Implementation-of-MLP-with-Numpy
Implementation of Multi-Layer Perceptron with Numpy and CNN with PyTorch in Image Classification


### Image classification
### Implementation From Scratch (Numpy)

* **Multi-Layer Perceptron** (MLP/Neuron Networks) with **backpropagation** and **mini-batch SGD**

  **Activations:**
  * Relu
  * Sigmoid
  * Softmax
  * Leaky_relu

  **Layers:**
  * Forward
  * Backward
  * Number of layers determined by user

**AND**

* **Pytorch CNN Convoluntional Neuron Network**

  **Layers:**
  * Convoluntional layer (Extract different features from *various feature maps*)
  * Pooling layer (Max pooling - average pooling: extract dominant features, speed up training speed)
  * Batch Normalization
  * Dropout 

**Data used:**
* [CIFAR-10](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) with 10 classes
